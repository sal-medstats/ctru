Description: The functions contained within this package simplify some of the
    repetitive tasks common to most studies carried out in the Clinical Trials
    Research Unit in the School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) at the
    University of Sheffield. Because all studies utilise the 'bespoke' database
    Prospect the structure of data exported from Prospect (dumps of simple ASCII
    text-files of the underlying tables in the relational database) whilst unique
    to each study have common features. Similarly much of the analyses have
    common features such as performing Intention To Treat (ITT) and Per-Protocol
    (PP) analyses which will invariably need to be presented side-by-side for
    comparisson. The functions in this package are an attempt to abstract and
    simplify such common tasks with a view to sharing code and reducing the amount
    of time and effort spent working in isolation.
